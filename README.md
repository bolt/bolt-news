Pilex
=====

A simple CMS, based on [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/). 

Installation: 

Create a new folder, and clone from github. Then use composer to get the Silex micro-framework and components:

    git clone git://github.com/bobdenotter/pilex.git .
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar install

And you're good to go.
